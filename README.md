# odin-recipes

This Repository cointains the first assignment of The Odin Project Curriculum. 
It starts from a Home page that contains three main links of 3 different recipes of: 
- Margherita Cake
- Vegan Muffin
- Pancakes
By doing so, I've achieved the main knwledge of HTML bases like:
 - boilerplate text, 
 - Headings differences
 - add links
 - add images
 - add ordered and unordered lists

 Now, I'm also more confident with the use of Git & GitHub and how to make:
  new directories (mkdir)
  change Directory (cd)
  create files (touch "namefile.extension")
